# OpenAPI 3.0 and Swagger UI

This was a learning exercise in creating Node Express API Documentation using the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification and providing a frontend interactive interface with Swagger UI

There is both an inline `JSDoc` implentation (unused) as well as a separate `.yaml` file implementation (used) (a `.json` implentation is currently missing).
